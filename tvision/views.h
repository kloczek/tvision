 * TGroup objects and their derivatives (called groups for short) provide the
 * central driving power to TVision.
 *
 * A group is a special breed of view. In addition to all the members derived
 * from @ref TView and @ref TStreamable, a group has additional members and
 * many overrides that allow it to control a dynamically linked list of views
 * (including other groups) as though they were a single object.
 *
 * We often talk about the subviews of a group even when these subviews are
 * often groups in their own right.
 *
 * Although a group has a rectangular boundary from its @ref TView ancestry, a
 * group is only visible through the displays of its subviews. A group draws
 * itself via the @ref draw() methods of its subviews. A group owns its
 * subviews, and together they must be capable of drawing (filling) the
 * group's entire rectangular bounds.
 * @see TView::draw
 *
 * During the life of an application, subviews are created, inserted into
 * groups, and displayed as a result of user activity and events generated by
 * the application itself. The subviews can just as easily be hidden, deleted
 * from the group, or disposed of by user actions (such as closing a window or
 * quitting a dialog box).
 *
 * Three derived object types of TGroup, namely @ref TWindow, @ref TDeskTop,
 * and @ref TApplication (via @ref TProgram) illustrate the group and
 * subgroup concept. The application typically owns a desktop object, a
 * status line object, and a menu view object. @ref TDeskTop is a TGroup
 * derivative, so it, in turn, can own @ref TWindow objects, which in turn own
 * @ref TFrame objects, @ref TScrollBar objects, and so on.
 *
 * TGroup overrides many of the basic @ref TView methods in a natural way.
 * TGroup objects delegate both drawing and event handling to their subviews.
 * You'll rarely construct an instance of TGroup itself; rather you'll
 * usually use one or more of TGroup's derived object types:
 * @ref TApplication, @ref TDeskTop, and @ref TWindow.
 *
 * All TGroup objects are streamable, inheriting from @ref TStreamable by way
 * of @ref TView. This means that TGroup objects (including your entire
 * application group) can be written to and read from streams in a type-safe
 * manner using the familiar C++ iostream operators.
